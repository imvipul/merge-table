# merge-table
To update table A (with millions of records) with data from table B (which has 0.5 million records), 
Updating a large table in Oracle with data from a smaller table can be challenging due to the volume of data and the potential for long transaction times and resource contention. Hereâ€™s an optimized approach to update table A with data from table B:

1. **Use a MERGE Statement**:
   The `MERGE` statement is optimized for such operations and can handle large datasets more efficiently.

2. **Batch Processing**:
   If the update operation is too large to handle in one go, consider processing the update in smaller batches.

3. **Indexes**:
   Ensure that the join condition columns are indexed to speed up the merge operation.

4. **Parallel Processing**:
   Utilize Oracle's parallel processing capabilities to improve performance.

Here's an example of how to use a `MERGE` statement to update table A with values from table B:

```sql
MERGE INTO tableA A
USING (SELECT r, t, y FROM tableB) B
ON (A.id = B.id)  -- Assuming 'id' is the join key between tableA and tableB
WHEN MATCHED THEN
UPDATE SET
    A.q = B.r,
    A.w = B.t,
    A.e = B.y;
```

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Ensure Indexes on Join Columns**:
   Indexes on the join columns can drastically improve performance.

   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_tableA_id ON tableA(id);
   CREATE INDEX idx_tableB_id ON tableB(id);
   ```

2. **Using the MERGE Statement**:
   The `MERGE` statement will update records in table A based on matching records in table B.

   ```sql
   MERGE INTO tableA A
   USING tableB B
   ON (A.id = B.id)  -- Assuming 'id' is the join key
   WHEN MATCHED THEN
   UPDATE SET
       A.q = B.r,
       A.w = B.t,
       A.e = B.y;
   ```

3. **Batch Processing**:
   If you encounter issues with the size of the update, consider breaking it into batches:

   ```sql
   DECLARE
       CURSOR c_ids IS SELECT id FROM tableB;
       v_id tableB.id%TYPE;
   BEGIN
       FOR r IN c_ids LOOP
           UPDATE tableA A
           SET (q, w, e) = (SELECT r, t, y FROM tableB B WHERE B.id = r.id)
           WHERE A.id = r.id;
           COMMIT; -- Commit after each batch, adjust the batch size as needed
       END LOOP;
   END;
   ```

4. **Parallel Processing**:
   Leverage parallelism if you have the necessary resources:

   ```sql
   ALTER SESSION ENABLE PARALLEL DML;

   MERGE /*+ PARALLEL(A 8) */ INTO tableA A
   USING tableB B
   ON (A.id = B.id)
   WHEN MATCHED THEN
   UPDATE SET
       A.q = B.r,
       A.w = B.t,
       A.e = B.y;

   ALTER SESSION DISABLE PARALLEL DML;
   ```

### Additional Considerations:

- **Statistics**: Ensure that table statistics are up to date to allow the optimizer to choose the best execution plan.
  
  ```sql
  BEGIN
      DBMS_STATS.GATHER_TABLE_STATS('SCHEMA_NAME', 'tableA');
      DBMS_STATS.GATHER_TABLE_STATS('SCHEMA_NAME', 'tableB');
  END;
  ```

- **Logging**: Consider disabling logging if your update process is logging intensive and if it is acceptable for your use case.

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE tableA NOLOGGING;
  ```

- **Space Management**: Ensure there is sufficient tablespace to accommodate the updates, especially if your table is very large.

By following these steps and optimizing for your specific environment, you can achieve a more efficient update operation.
