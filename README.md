# merge-table
To update table A (with millions of records) with data from table B (which has 0.5 million records), 
Updating a large table in Oracle with data from a smaller table can be challenging due to the volume of data and the potential for long transaction times and resource contention. 

## Option -1: MERE Statement
Hereâ€™s an optimized approach to update table A with data from table B:

1. **Use a MERGE Statement**:
   The `MERGE` statement is optimized for such operations and can handle large datasets more efficiently.

2. **Batch Processing**:
   If the update operation is too large to handle in one go, consider processing the update in smaller batches.

3. **Indexes**:
   Ensure that the join condition columns are indexed to speed up the merge operation.

4. **Parallel Processing**:
   Utilize Oracle's parallel processing capabilities to improve performance.

Here's an example of how to use a `MERGE` statement to update table A with values from table B:

```sql
MERGE INTO tableA A
USING (SELECT r, t, y FROM tableB) B
ON (A.id = B.id)  -- Assuming 'id' is the join key between tableA and tableB
WHEN MATCHED THEN
UPDATE SET
    A.q = B.r,
    A.w = B.t,
    A.e = B.y;
```

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Ensure Indexes on Join Columns**:
   Indexes on the join columns can drastically improve performance.

   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_tableA_id ON tableA(id);
   CREATE INDEX idx_tableB_id ON tableB(id);
   ```

2. **Using the MERGE Statement**:
   The `MERGE` statement will update records in table A based on matching records in table B.

   ```sql
   MERGE INTO tableA A
   USING tableB B
   ON (A.id = B.id)  -- Assuming 'id' is the join key
   WHEN MATCHED THEN
   UPDATE SET
       A.q = B.r,
       A.w = B.t,
       A.e = B.y;
   ```

3. **Batch Processing**:
   If you encounter issues with the size of the update, consider breaking it into batches:

   ```sql
   DECLARE
       CURSOR c_ids IS SELECT id FROM tableB;
       v_id tableB.id%TYPE;
   BEGIN
       FOR r IN c_ids LOOP
           UPDATE tableA A
           SET (q, w, e) = (SELECT r, t, y FROM tableB B WHERE B.id = r.id)
           WHERE A.id = r.id;
           COMMIT; -- Commit after each batch, adjust the batch size as needed
       END LOOP;
   END;
   ```

4. **Parallel Processing**:
   Leverage parallelism if you have the necessary resources:

   ```sql
   ALTER SESSION ENABLE PARALLEL DML;

   MERGE /*+ PARALLEL(A 8) */ INTO tableA A
   USING tableB B
   ON (A.id = B.id)
   WHEN MATCHED THEN
   UPDATE SET
       A.q = B.r,
       A.w = B.t,
       A.e = B.y;

   ALTER SESSION DISABLE PARALLEL DML;
   ```

### Additional Considerations:

- **Statistics**: Ensure that table statistics are up to date to allow the optimizer to choose the best execution plan.
  
  ```sql
  BEGIN
      DBMS_STATS.GATHER_TABLE_STATS('SCHEMA_NAME', 'tableA');
      DBMS_STATS.GATHER_TABLE_STATS('SCHEMA_NAME', 'tableB');
  END;
  ```

- **Logging**: Consider disabling logging if your update process is logging intensive and if it is acceptable for your use case.

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE tableA NOLOGGING;
  ```

- **Space Management**: Ensure there is sufficient tablespace to accommodate the updates, especially if your table is very large.

By following these steps and optimizing for your specific environment, you can achieve a more efficient update operation.

## Option -2: Using Cursor with `FORALL`

using `FORALL` with a cursor can improve performance by reducing context switches between the PL/SQL engine and the SQL engine. This approach can be beneficial when dealing with large data volumes. Here's an example of how you can use `FORALL` in conjunction with a cursor to update table A with data from table B:

1. **Declare Cursor and Collections**:
   Declare a cursor to fetch data from table B and collections to hold the fetched data.

2. **Bulk Collect Data**:
   Use `BULK COLLECT` to fetch data from the cursor into collections.

3. **Use FORALL for Bulk Update**:
   Use `FORALL` to update table A with the data from the collections.

### Example:

```sql
DECLARE
    TYPE id_array IS TABLE OF tableA.id%TYPE;
    TYPE q_array IS TABLE OF tableB.r%TYPE;
    TYPE w_array IS TABLE OF tableB.t%TYPE;
    TYPE e_array IS TABLE OF tableB.y%TYPE;
    
    v_ids id_array;
    v_qs q_array;
    v_ws w_array;
    v_es e_array;
    
    CURSOR c_tableB IS
        SELECT id, r, t, y FROM tableB;
        
BEGIN
    -- Bulk collect data from tableB
    OPEN c_tableB;
    LOOP
        FETCH c_tableB BULK COLLECT INTO v_ids, v_qs, v_ws, v_es LIMIT 10000; -- Adjust limit as needed
        
        EXIT WHEN v_ids.COUNT = 0;
        
        -- Use FORALL to perform bulk update
        FORALL i IN 1..v_ids.COUNT
            UPDATE tableA
            SET q = v_qs(i),
                w = v_ws(i),
                e = v_es(i)
            WHERE id = v_ids(i);
        
        -- Commit in batches to avoid long transactions
        COMMIT;
    END LOOP;
    CLOSE c_tableB;
    
    -- Final commit to ensure all changes are saved
    COMMIT;
END;
/
```

### Explanation:

1. **Declare Collections**:
   - `id_array`, `q_array`, `w_array`, and `e_array` are PL/SQL table types that will hold the data from table B.

2. **Cursor Declaration**:
   - `c_tableB` cursor selects `id`, `r`, `t`, and `y` from table B.

3. **Bulk Collect Data**:
   - Data is fetched in batches of 10,000 rows (adjustable) into the collections using `BULK COLLECT`.

4. **FORALL for Bulk Update**:
   - `FORALL` loop performs a bulk update on table A using the data in the collections.
   - This minimizes context switches and improves performance.

5. **Commit in Batches**:
   - Committing after each batch helps

avoid long transactions, reducing the risk of locks and rollbacks, and ensuring that the system can recover more easily in case of failure.

### Complete Example:

```sql
DECLARE
    TYPE id_array IS TABLE OF tableA.id%TYPE;
    TYPE q_array IS TABLE OF tableB.r%TYPE;
    TYPE w_array IS TABLE OF tableB.t%TYPE;
    TYPE e_array IS TABLE OF tableB.y%TYPE;
    
    v_ids id_array;
    v_qs q_array;
    v_ws w_array;
    v_es e_array;
    
    CURSOR c_tableB IS
        SELECT id, r, t, y FROM tableB;
        
BEGIN
    -- Bulk collect data from tableB
    OPEN c_tableB;
    LOOP
        FETCH c_tableB BULK COLLECT INTO v_ids, v_qs, v_ws, v_es LIMIT 10000; -- Adjust limit as needed
        
        EXIT WHEN v_ids.COUNT = 0;
        
        -- Use FORALL to perform bulk update
        FORALL i IN 1..v_ids.COUNT
            UPDATE tableA
            SET q = v_qs(i),
                w = v_ws(i),
                e = v_es(i)
            WHERE id = v_ids(i);
        
        -- Commit in batches to avoid long transactions
        COMMIT;
    END LOOP;
    CLOSE c_tableB;
    
    -- Final commit to ensure all changes are saved
    COMMIT;
END;
/
```

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Declare Collections**:
   - Define PL/SQL table types for the columns to be updated (`id_array`, `q_array`, `w_array`, and `e_array`).

2. **Cursor Declaration**:
   - Declare a cursor `c_tableB` to select the necessary columns (`id`, `r`, `t`, and `y`) from table B.

3. **Open Cursor and Fetch Data in Batches**:
   - Open the cursor and use `BULK COLLECT` to fetch data into the collections in batches of 10,000 rows. The batch size can be adjusted based on the available memory and performance considerations.

4. **FORALL for Bulk Update**:
   - Use `FORALL` to iterate over the collections and perform the update on table A. `FORALL` minimizes the context switches between PL/SQL and SQL engines, improving performance significantly.

5. **Commit in Batches**:
   - Commit the changes after each batch to manage transaction sizes and reduce the risk of locking and rollback issues.

6. **Final Commit**:
   - Ensure a final commit is executed after processing all the batches to make sure all changes are saved.

By following this approach, you can efficiently update a large table (table A) using data from a smaller table (table B) while optimizing performance and minimizing resource contention.
